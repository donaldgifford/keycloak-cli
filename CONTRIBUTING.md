# Contributing to keycloak-cli

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This document covers how to report
issues, propose changes, and submit pull requests.

## Quick start

```bash
mise install                      # toolchain pinned in mise.toml
just lint                         # lint
```

`just --list` enumerates every recipe.

## Reporting Issues

Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/donaldgifford/keycloak-cli/issues) for:

- **Bug reports** — include the version you are running, the command you ran,
  and the error you saw
- **Feature requests** — describe the problem you are trying to solve, not just
  the solution you have in mind
- For larger proposals, open an RFC document via `docz create rfc` and
  link it from the issue.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev) — installs the pinned toolchain (including
  `just`) from `mise.toml`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/donaldgifford/keycloak-cli.git
cd keycloak-cli
mise install
just lint    # runs linters
```

## Making Changes

### 1. Create a branch

Branch names follow the pattern `<type>/<short-description>`:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/plan-doc-type
git checkout -b fix/slug-truncation
git checkout -b docs/contributing-guide
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`

### 2. Make your changes

- Keep changes focused. One logical change per PR.
- Add or update tests for any code you change.
- Run `just lint` and `just test` before pushing.

### 3. Commit

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat(cmd): add plan document type
fix(template): truncate slug at word boundary
docs: update README with configuration reference
test(index): add dry-run edge case tests
```

Format:
```
<type>(<scope>): <imperative subject>

<optional body explaining why, not what>
```

### 4. Open a pull request

Push your branch and open a PR against `main`. The PR description should:

- Explain what changed and why
- Link to the related issue (if any) with `Fixes #123` or `Refs #123`
- Include a test plan or describe how you verified the change
